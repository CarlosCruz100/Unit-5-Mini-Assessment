# Unit 5 Mini-Assessment

Your goal is to make a 1-question quiz that checks the user's answers and tells them their score!


## Part 1: Answers and Variables

1. Read through the variables that are already there. Take note of what they represent.


## Part 2: .onclick and conditionals
2. Create a .onclick event handler for the first button.
   
3. In the event handler, use the .value method to store the first user input in a variable.
   
4. In the event handler, write a conditional to check if the user got the answer right.

5. In the conditional, use .innerHTML to tell the user if their answer was correct or wrong. Your message must include the user's actual answer.
   
   - For example, your message may say 'Wrong, your answer was 12. Try again!'
   - OR, 'Correct, your answer was 11!'

   HINT: Use string concatenation!!


## Challenges

- Create some kind of counter that increments every time the user presses the button to count how many times they've tried the quiz. Display this counter to the screen somewhere.
  
- Can you make a message or a screen pop up after they've tried the quiz a certain number of times? For example, "you've tried 5 times, you are now locked out" or something like that?
